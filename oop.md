### Object-Oriented Programing
First, what is Object-Orienting Programming? 
That’s a great question! **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a way  of structuring programs so that properties (data) and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

> For example, you could have a Car object with properties like make, model, type of engine, number of doors, etc. and functions like start, stop, speed up, or change lanes.
A classic example of an object is representing a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running.

Object-oriented programs has several benefits including things like <em>reusability</em> and <em>scalability</em>. The reusability of objects allows developers to quickly write code because the same functionality can be used in multiple places within the program with the assurance that it will behave the same way. This is also important for scalability of a codebase. As a codebase grows, it because more complex and changing or adding features will be more difficult but the use of OOP makes the process easier.

One of the most important steps in OOP is to understand what the objects will be and how they will relate to one another. This process is called data modeling and usually occurs at the beginning of the coding process. 

>Let’s say a team of developers wants to build a forums or discussion board to promote community within their app and gain some benefits of search engine optimization because the forums would have lots of questions/answers associated to that particular topic. The developers would have to understand what the data model is for the forums. How would categories or topics be handled? What would a post and the replies look like? Is there some kind of gamification where users who are more involved or have better answers to the questions ask get some kind of reward? What are the various types of users (admins vs a normal user)? All these things under consideration when you are building features in your app is data modeling.

In the next couple of lessons, we are going to look at the 4 core concepts of object-oriented programming.

- Lesson 1: Encapsulation
- Lesson 2: Abstraction
- Lesson 3: Inheritance
- Lesson 4: Polymorphism
